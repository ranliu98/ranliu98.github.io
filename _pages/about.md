I am a PhD candidate in the Machine Learning Program at [Georgia Tech](https://ml.gatech.edu/) (class of 2024).
I was fortunate to have interned at [Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/), [Cajal Neuroscience](https://www.cajalneuro.com/), and [Meta](https://about.meta.com/) for the past few years.
Currently, I conduct my research in the Neural Data Science Lab advised by [Prof. Eva L. Dyer](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/).
Previously, I got my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University majoring in physics working on Quantum Hall effect and Superconductors.

**I am looking for a full-time position starting in Fall 2024.**

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine (Deep) Learning, Computational/Cognitive Neuroscience, and Computer Vision. I am interested in developing more generalizable and interpretable deep learning methods for sequential systems and vision, and using them to accelerate scientific discovery.
The research projects that I worked on, or am actively working on include: 
* **Representation learning and generative models**: Learning without explicit human annotation through self-supervision and generative modeling methods.
* **Interpretable deep learning methods**: Building deep learning architectures 1) that are more interpretable under certain pre-defined conditions or assumptions, and 2) that align better to out-of-distribution domains and downstream tasks.
* **Multi-modal learning**: Learning on multi-modal data in a more efficient and effective manner.

Outside from research, I do indoor climbing and I have two catsüê±.
