I am a 4th-year PhD student in the Machine Learning Program at [Georgia Tech](https://ml.gatech.edu/). 
I conduct my research in the Neural Data Science Lab advised by [Prof. Eva L. Dyer](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine (Deep) Learning, Computational Neuroscience, and Computer Vision. 
The research projects that I worked on, or am actively working on include: 
<li> Representation learning: Developing self-supervised learning and generative learning methods to obtain robust representation of neural data without relying on explicit human annotation.
<li> Interpretable deep learning methods: Building deep learning architectures that are interpretable and identifiable under certain conditions or assumptions. 
<li> Image segmentation: Efficient methods for image segmentation with limited annotations (weakly-supervised learning, few-shot learning).


### Selected publications
  
  [1] Liu, Ran, et al. "Seeing the forest and the tree: Building representations of both individual and collective dynamics with transformers." (NeurIPS 2022).
  
  [2] Liu, Ran, et al. "Drop, swap, and generate: A self-supervised approach for generating neural activity." (NeurIPS 2021 oral).
