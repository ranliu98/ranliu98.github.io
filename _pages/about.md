I am a second-year PhD student in Machine Learning at [Georgia Tech](https://ml.gatech.edu/) with Electrical and Computer Engineering [(ECE)](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) as my home department. I conduct my research in the Neural Data Science Lab advised by [Prof. Eva Dyer](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine (Deep) Learning, Computational Neuroscience, and Computer Vision. Specifically, I am interested in representation learning and generative learning, with a focus on utilizing machine perception to aid in the understanding of neuroimaging datasets.
