I am a PhD in the Machine Learning Program at [Georgia Tech](https://ml.gatech.edu/) (class of 2024).
I was fortunate to have interned at [Apple AI/ML](https://machinelearning.apple.com/), [Cajal Neuroscience](https://www.cajalneuro.com/), and [Meta](https://about.meta.com/) for the past few years.
Currently, I conduct my research in the Neural Data Science Lab advised by [Prof. Eva L. Dyer](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/).
Previously, I got my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University majoring in physics working on Quantum Hall effect and Superconductors.

I will join Apple AI/ML as a research scientist in 2024 Fall. üçé

My ultimate goal is to create a next-generation deep learning framework that incorporates **logic**. I believe that the critical path toward achieving this involves developing large-scale learning methods that are both more generalizable and explainable. To this end, I have been focusing on the following topics:
* **Large-scale Pretraining and Alignment for Time Series (TS) and Beyond**: Bias in large models ([ICML'24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11742)), Group-Aware Embeddings for transformers ([ICLR'24](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=c56TWtYp0W)), Frequency-Aware MAE ([ICLR'24 TS4H](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05927)), Foundation model for neurons ([NeurIPS'22](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/1022661f3f43406065641f16ce25eafa-Paper-Conference.pdf)), Content-Style separation for time-series ([NeurIPS'21](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/58182b82110146887c02dbd78719e3d5-Paper.pdf)).
* **Representation Learning, Contrastive Methods, and Data Augmentation**: Alignment theory for contrastive learning (coming soon), Sample-aware augmentation ([WACV'24](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2024/papers/Liu_LatentDR_Improving_Model_Generalization_Through_Sample-Aware_Latent_Degradation_and_Restoration_WACV_2024_paper.pdf)), Upsampling augmentation for graphs ([ICML'23](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/azabou23a/azabou23a.pdf)), Cross-sample augmentation in SSL ([NeurIPS'21 SSLTP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10106)).
* **Generative Modeling and Segmentation of Medical Images**: Open-source dataset for multiscale brain modeling ([NeurIPS'22 DnB](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/22fb65e39d318c4b5b56fbe9cb082e3f-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf)), Multiscale brain modeling ([ICIP'21](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9506174)), Population-level variability in brain ([MICCAI'20](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.134635v1.full.pdf)).

Outside of research, I am a fan of indoor climbing, fine dining, and playing with my two lovely catsüê±.

I am also somewhat of a hunter. ![MH_Gunlance_Icon_White](https://github.com/ranliu98/ranliu98.github.io/assets/50523032/0cf58f1e-e0c6-4e24-8cce-a26889cb3648)
