I am a first-year PhD student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). Last semester I was working with [Prof. Diyi Yang](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/experience.html) at her NLP lab. I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and their application to address societal challenges.

I received my bachelor of science degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in Physics. I took quite a few courses about Computer Science, Social Science, and Mathematics during my undergraduate study.

The world is a mystery to me. Hence, I decide that I will be trying to become an excellent observer of people's behavior.
