I am a 4th-year PhD student in the Machine Learning Program at [Georgia Tech](https://ml.gatech.edu/) (class of 2024). 
I conduct my research in the Neural Data Science Lab advised by [Prof. Eva L. Dyer](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/).
I got my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University majoring in physics.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine (Deep) Learning, Computational Neuroscience, and Computer Vision. I am curious about how deep learning could be used to accelerate scientific discovery, and thus how to design better deep learning models for science.
The research projects that I worked on, or am actively working on include: 
* **Representation learning**: Developing self-supervised learning and generative learning methods to obtain robust representation of neural data without relying on explicit human annotation.
* **Interpretable deep learning methods**: Building deep learning architectures that are interpretable and identifiable under certain pre-defined conditions or assumptions.
* **Image segmentation**: Efficient methods for image segmentation with limited or noisy annotations, explicit constraints, or topological/geometrical priors.

Outside from research, I do indoor climbing and I have two cats.
