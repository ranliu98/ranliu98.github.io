I am a second-year PhD student at [the Center for Machine Learning at Georgia Tech](https://ml.gatech.edu/) with [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) as my home department. I conduct my research in the Neural Data Science Lab advised by [Prof. Eva Dyer](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/). My research interest is in representation learning and generative learning, with a focus on utilizing machine perception to aid in the understanding of neuroimaging datasets.

I received my bachelor of science degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in Physics. I took quite a few courses about Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics during my undergraduate study.
