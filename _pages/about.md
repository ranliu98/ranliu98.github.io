I am a second-year PhD student at [the Center for Machine Learning at Georgia Tech](https://ml.gatech.edu/) with [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) as my home school. I conduct my research in the Neural Data Science Lab advised by [Prof. Eva Dyer](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/). My research interest includes representation learning, generative learning, and their application in neuroimaging datasets. My research focuses on how we can better utilize machine perception to aid in the understanding of biomedical datasets.

I received my bachelor of science degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in Physics. I took quite a few courses about Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics during my undergraduate study.
