2022-09-14 Two of our papers [Seeing the forest and the tree: Building representations of both individual and collective dynamics with transformers]() and [MTNeuro: A Benchmark for Evaluating Representations of Brain Structure Across Multiple Levels of Abstraction]() were accepted by NeurIPS 2022!

2022-05-30 Our paper [Building representations of different brain areas through hierarchical point cloud networks](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=3GeifJ_GCg0) was accepted by [MIDL 2022](https://2022.midl.io/). This project is completed by Joy Jackson, an amazing undergrad that I mentored!

2022-05-16 I will start an internship at Cajal Neuroscience this summer.


2021-11-12 Two of our papers [Using self-supervision and augmentations to build insights into neural coding]() and [Mine your own view: A self-supervised approach for learning representations of neural activity]() were accepted by NeurIPS 2021 Workshop: Self-Supervised Learning Theory and Practice. Check them out [here](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2021/Schedule?showEvent=21853).

2021-09-28 Our paper [Drop, Swap, and Generate: A Self-Supervised Approach for Generating Neural Activity](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.21.453285v1?rss=1) was accepted by [Neurips 2021](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021) for an **oral presentation** (less than 1%).

2021-05-24 I will start an internship at Facebook this summer.

2021-05-20 Our paper [Multi-scale modeling of neural structure in X-ray imagery](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9506174) was accpeted by [IEEE ICIP 2021](https://2021.ieeeicip.org/).

2021-02-19 Our paper [Mine Your Own vieW: Self-Supervised Learning Through Across-Sample Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10106) is available on arXiv now.

2020-07-10 Our paper [A generative modeling approach for interpreting population-level variability in brain structure](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.134635v1.abstract) was accepted by [MICCAI 2020](https://www.miccai2020.org/en/). You can view the project in our project page [Brainsynth](https://nerdslab.github.io/brainsynth/).

2020-06-04 Our paper [A generative modeling approach for interpreting population-level variability in brain structure](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.134635v1.abstract) is available on bioRxiv now.

2020-01-10 I joined Prof. Eva Dyer's lab.
