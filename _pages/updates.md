2021-05-24 I will start an internship in Facebook this summer.

2021-05-20 Our paper Multi-scale modeling of neural structure in X-ray imagery is accpeted by [IEEE ICIP 2021](https://2021.ieeeicip.org/).

2021-02-19 Our paper [Mine Your Own vieW: Self-Supervised Learning Through Across-Sample Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10106) is available on arXiv now.

2020-07-10 Our paper [A generative modeling approach for interpreting population-level variability in brain structure](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.134635v1.abstract) is accepted by [MICCAI 2020](https://www.miccai2020.org/en/). You can view the project in our project page [Brainsynth](https://nerdslab.github.io/brainsynth/).

2020-06-04 Our paper [A generative modeling approach for interpreting population-level variability in brain structure](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.134635v1.abstract) is available on bioRxiv now.
